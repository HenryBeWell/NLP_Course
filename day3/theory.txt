1. Why do we use Derivative / Gredient to fit a target function?
ans:可以帮助我们更高效找到**局部**最优结果的拟合函数
2. In the words 'Gredient Descent', what's the Gredient and what's the Descent?
ans:在微积分里面，对多元函数的参数求∂偏导数，把求得的各个参数的偏导数以向量的形式写出来,即梯度;沿着梯度向量相反的方向，梯度减少最快，也就是更加容易找到函数的最小值。
3. What's the advantages of the 3rd gradient descent method compared to the previous methods?
ans:在测量同一问题下,梯度下降优化算法,能更清晰,便捷地得到最优结果
4. Using the simple words to describe: What's the machine leanring.
ans:算法,数据,特征,优化


1. Why do we need dynamic programming? What's the difference of dynamic programming and previous talked `search` problem? 
ans: 动态规划实际上是对搜索问题的剪枝,在某些问题中,使用动态规划更高效.
2. Why do we still need dynamic programming? Why not we train a machine learning to fit a function which could get the `right` answer based on inputs?
ans:在我的理解中,动态规划更简单,更轻盈,而机器学习更加厚重,繁琐;针对同一个问题,在得到的结果都是一样的情况下,为什么不用更简单的方法呢?(奥卡姆的剃刀)
3. Can you catch up at least 3 problems which could solved by Dynamic Programming? 
ans:

ans:
5. Please summarize the three main features of Dynamic Programming, and make a concise explain for each feature. 
ans:1.
6. What's the disadvantages of Dynamic Programming? (You may need search by yourself in Internet)
